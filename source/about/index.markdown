# Om Prakash Singh

I worked as Unix/Linux SA for around 11 years and moved to Engineering where I am responsible for automation, tools and writing utilities. I am also reposible for finding amicable solution/workflow to work to ease day-to-day operation. I provide technical cosultancy to NGOs and Startups. 

When I am free, I prefer reading books and writing techincal blogs.
