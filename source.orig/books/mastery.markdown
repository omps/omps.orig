{% blockquote %}
Everyone holds his fortune in his own hands, like a sculptor the raw material he will fashion into a figure. But it's the same with that type of artistic activity as will all others: we are merely born with the capability to do it. The skill to mold the material into what we want must be learned and attentively cultivated.

            - JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE

This is my first review of any book which is non-technical, [Robert Greene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Greene_(American_author)) is an American author already renowned for his work for [The 48 Laws of Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_48_Laws_of_Power). It took me two months to complete this book, mainly for the reason I was not able to put enough time to finish it. This book was a recommendation from another renowned author, blogger and a VC [James Altucher](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/) in his blog [Ten books to expand your brains](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2015/09/books-brain-expand/). 
The book is about motivation and the secret to become master in the field you work. This tell us about the importance of practice, understanding and learning. This also speaks about when is the right time when you have to move alone and find your path for success. Not all the time you will achieve the success, but all the time you would be guided on to the path where you understand better, more clear and able to create on your own. The book depicts the importance of mentor who will show you the right direction, but most important it speaks volumes about your internal desire to be curious, learn and master it.

We all face at times the sudden struck of lightning of our thoughts and then we just know what we have to do next. This sudden strike of lightning is nothing but the sense of being aware of the solution which already existed within us to the problem we trying so hard to find. The masters in this book or the people who have reached the level of mastery gets this same to. The author tries to tell us that how these people have worked hard and reached to the level where they understand these differently which is adding their thought to the learning which they get on the way they achieve mastery. But none of them stop there, the master continues to move to solve complex problems, find simple solution, explain those to the world and repeat. The most amazing part of being related with this is the Author has really picked people who were normal by all means; all their life, an haven't got all the important milestones in their life quite easily, about their struggles to cope up and importantly about their hunger to learn; who eventually ended up being masters. Some like, Madam Curie, Albert Einstein, Mozart.

This is one of the finest book I have read, it has opened the possibility of achievements, but it comes with price and the price is nothing more than your hard work and practice to evolve further. I work hard but don't practice enough will not make me understand the simplest of principle in the long run, Robert Greene tries to tell the same. Its the amount of practice, thought, learn and hard work we put will define us going further. Nothing else matters. :)
