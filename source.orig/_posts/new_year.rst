==========
Lets Begin
==========

   This is the beginning of the new year, when in the past year, I have not done any significant blogging and I am pretty ashamed of falling through of achiving my targets. Hope to make this year more eventful.

   Though I had my WP blog coming down. Someone screwed is miserably, the database lost, and unable to recreate most stuff. I am fixing my blog this year and updating all my content. I think a small todo would help me achieve what should  be done for making this work all again.

**TODO LIST**
 - [ ] Migrate to pelican and gh-pages.
 - [ ] Recover and publish whatever of the 30 days emacs challenege is present.
 - [ ] Completed you 30 Days emacs challenge.
 - [ ] Figure out how to publish from pelican to social media.
