<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>vagrant status
Current machine states:

default                   not created <span class="o">(</span>virtualbox<span class="o">)</span>

The environment has not yet been created. Run <span class="sb">`</span>vagrant up<span class="sb">`</span> to
create the environment. If a machine is not created, only the
default provider will be shown. So <span class="k">if</span> a provider is not listed,
<span class="k">then</span> the machine is not created <span class="k">for</span> that environment.
