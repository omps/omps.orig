  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sixth day of writing my content, I had never thought i would be even writing for this many posts continuously(I am kind of a lazy writer) and I realize this experience of writing blogs and sharing my learnings or acquired knowledge is actually encouraging. I started to think that if I am able to put some extra time and effort, I may also complete a lot of things by taking similar challenegs. My priority ones are loosing weight(I am still finding myself in tough situation on to get myself motivated) and learning the python programming language, which as I had been told is pretty easy to learning. I may get inconsistent at times due to other priorities coming up, but writing my learnings and posting everyday keeps me motivated and keep reminiding me I have pending stuff to do.</p>

<p>Every emacs command has a name which can be used against the convenient key bindings. Most emacs commands doesn&rsquo;t have key bindings so the only way to learn them is to use them as commands, by emacs convention all the command will consist one or more words separated  by &lsquo;-&rsquo;. For eg. auto-fill-mode or manual-entry. So to enter a command, type M-x enter the command name RET (to execute), C-g (to cancel). Its something similar to what we discussed in our Day 5, to enter the mini-buffer run the command and execute it and it does work similar for completion as it is to be done in mini-buffer.</p>

<p>well there are many things which we need immediately and overlook to take the effort to read the manual, or say for LISP errors which we might not be aware of, the freenode.org IRC network&rsquo;s #emacs channel is the best place after failed attempt of finding any help on google and emacswiki.org. but again at the same time emacs itself has a very awesome online documentation for reference. Online means it is accessible within emacs all the time. The help commands are easily accessible with &lsquo;C-h&rsquo; help character, after this we usually put the character for which we are seeking help and can be canceled the same way as all the mini-buffers. &lsquo;C-h&rsquo; itself a help option, so typing &lsquo;C-h C-h&rsquo; will print the available help characters. Apart from C-h, F1 can also  be used. I have put some simple stuff about how to ask help in Emacs at &lt;<a id="put-the-link-here" name="put-the-link-here"></a>. A more detailed list s below.</p>

<p>Similarly apropos are the commands which may answer certain questions as &ldquo;what are the commands for working with files?&rdquo;. specifying a apropos pattern such as a word, a list of words, or regular expressions, each apropos command display a list of item that matches the pattern in a separate window.</p>

<p>I just completed through the help documentation in emacs manual, and I am convinced the emacs has got the most extensive documentation an editor could ever have, the above table tries to cover as many things as possible but I am pretty sure, I would have definitely missed things, like this that once on IRC I had been suggested some lisp code to quickly take me to the help page and I missed it. Well, on many modern keyboards F1 as well works to call the help function.</p>

<p>While doing the typing I do make a lot of mistakes and undo is the most fundamental command for correcting the mistakes. C-/ does the same trick as C-x u and C-_ all meant to undo my work. If you see the buffers have been modified accidentaly, the easiest way is to press <strong>C-/</strong> repetadely unless the stars disappears from the mod line. Just press <strong>C-/</strong> to see the last change, so that we can understand if the change was intentional, if yes then we can leave it like this, if no then we can undo by pressing <strong>C-/</strong> repeatedly.</p>

<p>Its much easier to transpose characters in emacs using *C-t*(transpose-chars)  and transpose words using *M-t*(transpose-words) and moves the word containing or preceding point forward as tell, though it does not move any punctutation mark, for eg, FOO, BAR will become BAR, FOO. *C-M-t*(transpose-sexps) is similar to transposing two expressions and *C-x C-t*(transpose-lines) for transposing lines. The numeric command works here, it tell the transpose command to move forward the character before or containing point across several other characters.</p>

<p><strong>M&#x2013; M-l</strong> Convert last word to lower-case, it is Meta-Minus. <strong>M&#x2013; M-u</strong> Convert last word to uppercase. <strong>M&#x2013; M-c</strong> convert last word to lowercase with capital letters.</p>

<p>The spell checking ability of any editor should be good for the writer to help check spells on the fly, and emacs does have some nifty commands to do that as well. We need aspell, ispell, hunspell installed on the system for these commands to work. Once started the programs continue to run so that subsequent spell check commands complete more quickly and can be killed using <strong>M-x ispell-kill-ispell</strong> but is not required as it does not uses much memory and only active when spelling correcting is done, these programs using two dictionaries one is the standard dictionary and the other is our defined dictionary. The local dictionary can be defined by &ldquo;ispell-local-dictionary* or if nil by "ispell-dictionary&rdquo; or if both is nil then the default dictinary is selected. The variable &ldquo;ispell-complete-word-dict&rdquo; specifies the file name for its dictionary and is used for word completion. Flyspell mode is fully automatic mode of checking the words in the buffer as we insert them or edit them, when it finds the words it doesn&rsquo;t recognize it highlights that word. Right now I am seeing my buffer so colorful, thanks to flyspell mode, and my typing :). <strong>M-x flyspell-mode</strong> toggles the flyspell mode, to turn on flyspell mode for all text buffer <strong>turn-on-flyspell-mode</strong> to <strong>text-mode-hook</strong>.</p>

<p>Well. I am done for the Day 6, being emacs is such a vast entity as an editor, i spend most of my time going through the help document and manual pages only and enable myself to write quality content, which should help me or any one else who might want to use my content for his/her reference. I am still at a very primitive level of doing things with emacs, but I am aware I am still to young here. I will put these text on git hub as well, for anyone to help me correcting the content or if adding anything more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Emacs have a minibuffer, and called the same because of its small screen space, the minibuffer resides in the same area as echo area so many time when any error or informative message appear in the echo area, it just hides the minibuffer for a few seconds or till the time any new keypress is made.</p>

<p>Minibuffer can be activated using typing text to it, and exited by typing <strong><RET></strong> (execute the command) or <strong>C-g</strong> (cancel the command). The minibuffer prompt shows the default arguments suppose the commands that read buffer names usually show buffer name as the default and can be activated using <strong><RET></strong></p>

<p>When finding a file in emacs, for opening or creating one, the minibuffer usually open the default dir, the default directory is stored in buffer-local variable as &lsquo;default-directory&rsquo;, now whenever emacs will read a filename using a minibuffer it will insert the directory name of the file being opened.</p>

<p>Emacs interpret &lsquo;~/&rsquo; as your home directory. you can specify something like this in case you do not want to type the complete path from where you want your files to be opened / created.</p>

<p>The minibuffer in emacs is also a buffer and the usual emacs commands are available for editing. <strong><RET></strong> in the minibuffer submits the argument and the same cannot be used to insert a new line and can be done with <strong>C-q C-j</strong> and <strong>C-o</strong>. The keys <TAB>, <SPC>, and ? are bound to completion of the commands.</p>

<p>When the minibuffer is active, the echo area is treated like an ordinary Emacs window.</p>

<p>Minibuffer uses a feature called as completion these(<TAB>, <RET> and <SPC>) commands attempt to complete the text in the minibuffer, &lsquo;?&rsquo; usually provide a list of possible completions. These commands work by narrowing down a large list of to a smaller subsets of matches. Emacs perform completion using one or more of the below <em>Completion Styles</em>.</p>

<p>The variable  <span class="underline">completion styles</span> specify the completion style to use.</p>

<p>M-x uses the minibuffer to read the name of a command, so completion works by matching the minibuffer text with available emacs commands.</p>

<p>THe commands for completion works as defined in the minibuffer when the completion is allowed.</p>

<p><strong><TAB></strong>     complete as much as possible; if unable to complete display a list of possible completions (minibuffer-complete)</p>

<p><strong><SPC></strong>     Completes up to one word. (minibuffer-complete-word)</p>

<p><strong><RET></strong>     Submit the minibuffer text as argument. (minibuffer-complete-and-exit)</p>

<p><strong>?</strong>         Display list of completions. (minibuffer-complete-help)</p>

<p><strong>Mouse-1</strong>   Clicking mouse button 1 or 2 on a completion alternative chooses it
<strong>Mouse-2</strong>   (mouse-choose-completion).</p>

<p><strong>M-v</strong>       Selects the window showing the completion list. (switch-to-completion)
<strong><PageUp></strong>  and then we can use the below pageup and prior commands.
<strong><prior></strong></p>

<p><strong><Right></strong>    (next-completion) this moves to point following alternatives.</p>

<p><strong><Left></strong>    (previous-completion) this moves to previous alternatives.</p>

<p>There are many modes in emacs which let you do so many things with the minibuffer, some noted ones are ido-mode and helm-mode.</p>

<p>Ido mode is part of the emacs from version 22.</p>

<p>I will cover these modes in my later learnings, and keep updating.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am  becoming such an inconsistent learner and writer and have been not being able to post any new learnings a from last 4 days for emacs, but sometimes the work just take over us and do not allow any bandwidth, this really could be a lame excuse, but my sincerely I should be keeping my posts regular.</p>

<p>Again, it&rsquo;s more the like learning from your (in this case my) mistakes and going through your work again and again it&rsquo;s a way of reorganising your work and fixing it wherever necessary, I would also need help to understanding the mistakes we should avoid overlooking while technical writing or a posting on a blog.</p>

<h2>What new there could be there inserting text, believe me, emacs is pandora box for writers and enthusiasts.</h2>

<p>There is so much written in the #emacs manual <code>C-h r</code>, and this time it was the keys <code>C-q</code> or <code>C-x 8</code> this is used to print literals or Unicode characters by specifying their Hex or octal code. For eg, we have a key on keyboard as &lsquo;Del&rsquo; which is used to delete the character  on the point and move backward(from right to left, when the text displays from left to right or otherwise in case text being displayed the other way). The C-q combination when pressed will make the delete key type type the literal &lsquo;DEL&rsquo; instead of acting as text eraser, and the same goes for RET, when you press RET(RETURN or ENTER on some keyboard) we get RET as the literal. But really I want to insert a blank line could it be C-\n (new line character), well that is going to be a cryptic I am sure emacs doesn&rsquo;t treat it&rsquo;s commands this way and I can simply press <strong>C-o</strong> and similarly <strong>C-x C-o</strong> delete all but the last blank line, good gracious I was too fed up with doing C-k to delete my empty lines :) and similarly <strong>C-j</strong> is for entering a new line.</p>

<p>I want to count the no of words in my selected region or in the buffer, M-= and C-u M-= comes to the rescue. The latter would count the no. of words in the buffer. The command C-x = would do the display the information for my cursor position. Quoting from the emacs manual.</p>

<p>We can also move around the buffer with providing the numeric argument, the most simpler is to use the &lsquo;Meta&rsquo; command with the no. The keys M-1, M-2 as well as M&#x2013; are bound to commands (digit-argument and negative-argument) and set up argument for the next command.</p>

<p>For example I want to go down by 5 lines</p>

<p>M-5 C-n</p>

<p>I was just wondering now what if I want to write 5 o&rsquo;s in line, well thats another question to worry why I would like to do, but how to do in Emacs, and well M-5 0 C-n is not going to do this(i.e. insert 5 0 and go to next line). So, to achieve this  press <strong>M-5 C-u 0</strong> does the trick. We now know there is another way of inserting a <em>Numeric Argument</em> and that is using <strong>C-u</strong>, but when type alone it does have its own special meaning of 4 characters. &lsquo;C-u C-u C-f&rsquo; will move you 16 characters, &lsquo;C-u C-u C-o&rsquo; will make a lot of blank lines, and C-u C-k will kill 4 lines. :)</p>

<p>It would be good to know that emacs is powerful to repeat commands as well, the way it worked in Shell, but I think its pretty ahead of its time, and in one command itself you can ensure you can repeat the command as many times as you want. The trick is to use <strong>C-x z</strong>, if I have used a command &lsquo;C-u 2 0 C-d&rsquo; to delete 20 characters, we can repeat this same command using &lsquo;C-x z&rsquo; and insert &lsquo;z&rsquo; as many times you want to run the previous command. cool. For deleting 100 chars I may need to write like &lsquo;C-x z z z z z&rsquo; should remove 100 characters. <em>Note: this command will not change the arguments in the previous command</em></p>

<p>So we checked out the below in commands today.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>The windows and the buffer.<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a></h1>

<p>I will touch upon one new topic and what I learned today. While writing my <a href="http://www.omps.in/blog/2015/11/14/day-2-the-real-estate/">Day 2</a> article I learnt intersting usage of windows and frames (well, the one where we do our editing and writing stuff. It would be good to understand how opening emacs creates the frame and window within.)</p>

<p>We start emacs the same way we start our other application. (on Linux, by typing on the terminal window; on Windows and Mac, clicking on to the application icon.) When emacs starts up it usually display a special buffer name <strong>GNU Emacs</strong>. This contains information about emacs and links to common good stuff for begineers(in later days we will figure out how we can skip this)</p>

<p>It is good not to start multiple emacs session, instead just start once and do all the editing in the same sessions. In this way the emacs context accumlates valuable context, such as kill ring, registers, undo history, which helps a lot at advanced stages.</p>

<h2>Buffer<a id="sec-1-1" name="sec-1-1"></a></h2>

<p>The text we are going to edit in emacs is called as buffers and is used to hold the files text. So everytime we visit a file, run dired, send message with &lsquo;C-x m&rsquo; or ask for help, a buffer is used for holding the text of the message.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h4>The Emacs Real estate.</h4>

<p>This is about the screen organization of emacs, how the text is placed and how the screen is drawn for the editor, this is about telling you how the things in #emacs as they are, and why they are important this way. Though, i should have started understanding it and writng it down on Day 1, but understanding the key contol is equally important to me, if I did not had learned about it, I surely would have faced difficulty closing my emacs and moving around. Now let me just try to see how much I  am understanding about the screen here and how well I can put it in my words. :) ofcourse it is not a tech doc, but this my 30 Days challenege to learn more about emacs and understand emacs for good.</p>

<p>I would be mainly using a lot of images compared to lot of writing that, understanding the screen can better be understood by rightly poining to the correct area.</p>

<h5>The Screen</h5>

<p>Double clicking on the emacs icon does open up a GUI window and similarly typing it on command prompt from withing an X Windows system, I get the emacs as an editor with full flesh and bones, i actually means as an GUI application, like we see for other editors. And when  I do same while I am  on the command prompt with no X support, or with -nw or -t (with emacsclient, will write more about this in coming days.) i get the emacs taking up my entire terminal screen. We will call these frames and emace behaves almost similar in both these frames. It normally starts with just one frame, but many frames can be created.</p>

<p>Each frame consist of several distinct regions. as shown in the picture below.</p>

<p>The emacs frame consist of these important segments</p>

<h6>Point: Where editing takes place</h6>

<p>The place where the cusrsor is present is called as the point in a multiple windows emacs in GUI, the point can be moved by clicking the mouse in the respective region, the active window will have the curson as solid block and will appear to be on the cursor. While working with several buffers each buffer has its own valur for point.</p>

<h6>Echo area: Where the commands and messages appear at bottom of the frame.</h6>

<p>if you pause for more than a second in the middle of the command, you can see your commands being echoed in the echo area. it also shows you the error message when the command fails. The messages displayed in the echo area are generally saved in the special buffer calles as <strong>Messages</strong></p>

<h6>Mode Line: Understanding the mode line.</h6>

<p>At the bottom of every window there is a mode line.
The text displayed on the mode line has the following format
cs:ch-fr buf        pos line (major minor)</p>

<p>o cs  display the character set.</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">

<p>o fr   is the selected frame name, default is F1</p>

<p>o buf   usually the name of the file or the buffer.</p>

<p>o pos   where there is additional text above the top of the window or below the bottom.</p>

<td class="left">If you are at the bottom of the buffer</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="left">nn%</td>
<td class="left">nn is the percentage of buffer above the window</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>o line   &lsquo;L&rsquo; Followed by the line no. at point.</p>

<p>o major   Name of the major mode used in buffer, for eg. Text mode, Lisp Mode, Org Mode and so on.</p>

<p>o minor   minor mode are the list of enabled minor modes on top of major mode, for eg visual-line-mode, flyspell-mode</p>

<h6>The Menu Bar - How to use.</h6>

<p>On the graphical display you can just use the mouse to open the menu bar, an arrow to the right of the menu denotes the menu having a sub menu. Many commands in menu bar have ordinary key bindings as well.</p>

<p>On a text terminal menu bar can be opened using &rsquo;M-`&lsquo; or <F10>, or run the command tmm-menubar. Move around the menu bar using up and down arrow key, <RET> i.e enter key, to select the item or C-g to come out of the menu bar mode.</p>

<p>I know its been a little late today, but I was quite able to give time one weekends than as on weekdays, I just don&rsquo;t want to loose focus so am trying to keep up with my posts daily, hope these should be helpful, and I am seriously looking forward for your comments and suggestion, so do please keep posting, tomorrow I think I will go more about buffers and frames.</p>

<p>All in all I am enjoying and learning so many things while posting and writing.</p>

<p>Quoting from Emacs Manual
&ldquo; Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emacs is an advanced editor because of its ability to perform complex operations related to OS, by controlling subprocesses, indenting programs automatically, showing multiple files at once and ofcourse we can use it as text editor.
It is also a self-documenting means any time special command for help can be used for finding out what the particular command does.
Emacs can be eaisly altered to behave in certain prefrence and is highly customizable.
Emacs can go beyond simple customisation and can create entirely new commands. These new commands are simple program written in LISP.</p>

<h4>Downloading<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a></h4>

<ul>
<li>Downloaded Emacs: I downloaded for MAC OS X from <a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/">http://emacsformacosx.com/</a>. I had been suggested by many sites and also from the people on IRC #emacs channel, while you are learning to use emacs, do not start with a customised emacs. I believe it could be mainly because a lot of customisations are already done for you, hence limiting you learning curve. Well, downloading and installing with OS X is pretty simple and straight, I got &ldquo;Emacs Version 24.3 Universal Binary Released 2013-03-11&rdquo;. Double click on the installer and voilla the installation is completed on the fly.</li>
</ul>


<p>For windows and Linux you can download GNU Emacs releases from a <a href="http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/emacs/">nearby GNU mirror</a>; or if automatic redirection does not work see the list of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html">GNU mirrors</a>, or use the main <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs">GNU ftp server</a>.</p>

<p>GNU Emacs development is hosted on <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs/">savannah.gnu.org</a>.</p>

<h4>Working with emacs<a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a></h4>

<ul>
<li>Starting the editor: once downloaded and installed. From the Launchpad -> emacs, clicking on which took me to the editor in its full glory, with a nice welcome message with link to the manual and the beginner emacs tutorials to get a start working with emacs and to quickly get help in emacs &ldquo;C-h (Hold down Ctrl and Press h)</li>
</ul>


<h5>Few things to note and which is global to emacs.<a id="sec-2-1" name="sec-2-1"></a></h5>

<p>Control Key in emacs is denoted as &lsquo;C&rsquo;.
All or Esc Key in emacs is denoted as &rsquo;M' or referred in document as meta key.
Shift will be denoted as &rsquo;S'.</p>

<h5>Moving around<a id="sec-2-2" name="sec-2-2"></a></h5>

<p>Most movements in emacs can be controlled using the arrow keys but some still say it is not advisable and use of key sequences controled by Ctrl and Meta keys are advisable. below table helps in understanding the movements with these keys.</p>

<p>These are some of the common keys for moving around while in emacs. It seems its really hard for getting used to it, but as I am working with emacs for sometime, I started to feel it is most obvious to be like that.</p>

<p>I think most of the time as a beginner we could get along with using the arrow keys and we should highly discourage it and use the emacs specific keybindings to move around within emacs. Apart from bringing the emacs on and starting it up, the very important thing we should remeber is how to close it. During my initial days as emacs user I was not aware of quitting emacs, and have of the time ended in killing emacs from the process tree, now I feel so stupid. C-g and C-x C-c are the commands, which can help you all the time, while we are learning. I have heard more advanced user of emacs seldom close their emacs sessions and I may try to forget using C-x C-C again. It may take some time till I get there and stop closing my emacs and I am sure it would be more than 30 days.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h5>Applications for Kids.</h5>

<p>I was trying to figure out some application/games for kids based on Linux to teach my Kid about some programming, I tried to teach him some computer at times and found him very interested in leaning stuff. There must be many for windows but being myself an avid Linux user from quite a long time, I really want to introduce him to Linux quite early, unlike me, who got my hands on Linux late in life and still waiting to explore the endless possiblities it offers.<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a></p>

<p>There will always be these question, 1. Why computers? and 2. Why to kids? 3. Are they are smart enough to handle computers.</p>

<p>We have very common non-sensical answers or myths around which may suggest the Computers are only for grown ups and kids might not be able to handle the strain it may cause to their eyes, yes in this case I do agree, and hence we need to understand to limit their onscreen time; but doing this also we can ensure to learn our kids about computers.</p>

<p>Here is a list of few application which I was able to collate using the net and ofcoure google.com :)</p>

<h6><a href="http://gcompris.net/index-en.html">Gcompris</a> :<a id="sec-1-0-1" name="sec-1-0-1"></a></h6>

<p>Gcompris is a suite of around 100 games with different difficulty levels suited for kids between age 2-10, The activities are divided up between sections such as Math, Reading, Amusement. The entire suite is available on most of the distributions standard repostiries. Gcompris is a free software, which means I can adapt it, change it, improve it and most importantly can share this among thousands of other childrens who might want to use it. Below are some of the things Gcompris is offering.</p>

<ul>
<li>Computer discovery: keyboard, mouse, different mouse gestures, &#x2026;</li>
<li>arithmetic: table memory, enumeration, double entry table, mirror image, &#x2026;</li>
<li>science: the canal lock, the water cycle, the submarine, electric simulation &#x2026;</li>
<li>geography: place the country on the map</li>
<li>games: chess, memory, connect 4, oware, sudoku &#x2026;</li>
<li>reading: reading practice</li>
<li>other: learn to tell time, puzzle of famous paintings, vector drawing, cartoon making, &#x2026;</li>
</ul>


<p>More information on this project can be found at <a href="http://gcompris.net/index-en.html">Gcompris Website</a>. And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCompris">Gcompris Wikipedia</a> does has a simple overview of this project too.</p>

<p>On debian or debian alike systems, use</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install gcompris
</code></pre>

<h6><a href="http://tux4kids.alioth.debian.org/">Tux4Kids</a><a id="sec-1-0-2" name="sec-1-0-2"></a></h6>

<ol>
<li><p>Tuxtype</p>

<p>Tuxtype is an educational typing tutor for kids starting tux.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install tuxtype
</code></pre>

<p>for other installation instrcutions can be found at <a href="http://tux4kids.alioth.debian.org/tuxtype/download.php">http://tux4kids.alioth.debian.org/tuxtype/download.php</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Tuxpaint</p>

<p>There is a little painintg program to make your kid learn paint. This lets kids draw things and is good for them to learn moving the mouse and do other stuff. his remarkable drawing program empowers kids to be creative in an environment complete with magic tools and sound effects.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install tuxpaint
</code></pre>

<p>for other installation instrcutions can be found at <a href="http://www.tuxpaint.org/download/">http://www.tuxpaint.org/download/</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>TuxMath</p>

<p>Lets kids hone their arithmetic skills while they defend penguins from incoming comets, or offers them a chance to explore the asteroid belt with only their factoring abilities to bring them through safely</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install tuxmath
</code></pre>

<p>for other installation instrcutions can be found at <a href="http://tux4kids.alioth.debian.org/tuxmath/download.php">http://tux4kids.alioth.debian.org/tuxmath/download.php</a></p>

<p>I think for the beginning I will just go ahead and start with this.  May be when I have to teach him further about programming, I have my list complete with Scratch, Alice and Shoes which may help me if required in the next coming years.</p>

<p>BTW, forgot to mention there are real good linux distributions just aimed for kids, and may help kids learn a lot of things on their own while managing their own personal latops. The above utilities are good if you have only one machine and you want your kid to allow to use these too.</p>

<p>There are also articles for making to learn kids to program at <a href="http://archive09.linux.com/feature/155203">linux.com</a>. Some of them mentioned are scratch, Alice and Shoes.</p></li>
