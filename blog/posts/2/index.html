  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Mark and the region<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a></h1>

<p>Many command in Emacs operate on parts of the current buffer, to specify the text for such commands, we need to select the text, by marking it at one end of it and move the point to the other end. This text between the point and the mark is called as &ldquo;the region&rdquo; or &ldquo;the selection&rdquo;. This region always extend between the point and the mark, each time you move the point, the region changes.</p>

<p>Setting the mark at the position also &ldquo;activates&rdquo; it. Emacs indicates the extent by highlighting the text within it, using the &lsquo;region&rsquo; face. Further on customizing it can be found under <span class="underline">Face Customization</span>.</p>

<p>Once the commands are run the region, Emacs automatically deactivates this region and turns off the highlighting; this can also be explicitly deactivate by typing &lsquo;C-g&rsquo;. Movement commands <sethyperlink>  doesn&rsquo;t work on the region. The behaviour is known as Transient Mark mode. Disabling mark mode switched Emacs to an alternate behaviour. Also, when you mark something in one buffer, it doesn&rsquo;t have effect in anyother buffer, so while you come back you will see the mark still present at the same buffer at same location.</p>

<p>Here are some commands for setting the mark; C is still the ctrl and M- is Meta or Alt or Esc key on your keyboard.</p>

<p>OK, so now we know how to mark the text, but why really I want to do it, and learn so many combinations, when it can simply be done by holding and moving the mouse around, remind me of selecting text in browser; well, some real line usage is: say, you want to select some text and make it uppercase, so just select that area of text using any of the above key bindings and run C-x C-u, and you see all the characters becoming uppercase, neat isn&rsquo;t it, I can use this same mark to remember the text, but ofcourse I can select the position of my text in the buffer too, it reminds me something like bookmark, so for an example in a text file or a code of more than 1000 lines, I encounter something interesting, but have to move ahead also, for this I only see 2 ways, either select and copy the text and save it in some place, or just remember it, the emacs remember function just does that.  I selected a region and do not want to do anything with it as such, but just remember the position of the mark in the buffer type so I type &ldquo;C-SPC C-SPC&rdquo; just does that, i.e remember my position, and C-u C-SPC later jumps back to the mark. I will speak more about the mark ring further in Today itself.</p>

<p>Oh, now I know why I need it, but it may not be everytime I want to select the text and do something with it, so I activated the mark  by mistake using the key C-SPC and now wherever I move the cursor its just getting highlighted, and I am not sure what may happen if I type something, this is a time I really hate myself to be bought in, when I know how to enter into something, but do not know how to come out without making any unknown change. C-g comes to the rescue. It just is so cool, and a saviour isn&rsquo;t it.</p>

<p>Ah, there are endless commands in emacs, and if there aren&rsquo;t one you can always create one, its pretty simple. For eg. C-x C-x exchanges the positions of the point and the mark(I need to find out its practical use). And there are many ways too to set mark and selecting region
for eg. I can use mouse by pressing the left mouse button and moving around the text; clicking the right mouse button set the mark at point i.e first you click the left mouse button which will set the mark, right click to the place till where you want to make selection; further to this you can set the mark and use the cursor command or arrow keys to select the text. These are so cool tricks, I so despartley want to make video lessons now, nevermind will try to do some video lessons later once my 30 Days challenge is over.</p>

<p><em>Notes:</em>
<em>1. By any chance if your C-SPC is not working try using C-@ or vice-versa, this is also bound to the set mark command. I am not sure, but then some keyboards might not support C-SPC.</em></p>

<h2>Marking objects like word, list, paragraph or page.<a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a></h2>

<p>As we were taking earlier M-@ extend the mark on word and repeated invocation extend the region by advancing one word at a time and if the mark is active and located before point this same command moves the mark backward from its current position, one word at a time and while working with this we do not have to set the mark as well and it does accepts numeric arguments, so highlighting the next ten words would be C-u 10 M-@.</p>

<p>The Numerical argument and repeated invocation works with all the command mentioned in the table, ofcourse, not the last one which marks the whole buffer, I doubt repeated invocation would start marking other buffers too ;).</p>

<h2>Using the selected region and  Operating on the same<a id="sec-3" name="sec-3"></a></h2>

<ul>
<li>We can kill the region using C-w.</li>
<li>We can copy the region M-w.</li>
<li>Convert the case with C-x C-l or C-x C-u.</li>

<p><em>as its already covered in my previous days, so I will save some effort explaining again.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Undo change C-u C-/.</li>
<li>Replace text withing using M-%. (Yay!! I was wishing I could find something like this.)</li>
<li>Indent it with C-x TAB or C-M-\</li>
<li>Fill it as text with M-x fill-region.</li>
<li>Check the spelling M-$.</li>
<li>Evaluate the lisp code, if you have one M-x eval-region. (Got the similar tip sometime back on IRC, I was earlier while making changes to my .emacs. I was actually closing emacs and then opening again.)</li>
<li>Save it in a register. C-x r s.</li>
<li>and ofcourse save this region in some file. I will be coming to this soon.</li>

<h1>The Mark Ring<a id="sec-4" name="sec-4"></a></h1>

<p>The command C-SPC C-SPC is hndy when you want to use the mark to remember a poistion if I wish to remember and may return to it later. It pushes the current point into the mark ring, without activating the mark. To return to the position, we can use &lsquo;set-mark-command&rsquo; with a prefix argument C-u C-SPC. This moves the point to where the mark was and deactivates the mark if it was active.Each subsequent C-u C-SPC jumps to a prior position stored in the mark ring.</p>

<p>Each buffer has its own mark ring. All editing command use the current buffer&rsquo;s mark ring. In particular, C-u C-SPC always stays in the same buffer.</p>

<h2>Marking texts globally<a id="sec-5" name="sec-5"></a></h2>

<p>Apart from the ordinary mark ring that belongs to each buffer, Emacs has aloso a single mark mode &ldquo;global mark ring&rdquo;. Each time the mark is set, this is recorded in the global mark ring in addition to the current buffer&rsquo;s own mark ring.</p>

<h2>Shift Selection<a id="sec-6" name="sec-6"></a></h2>

<p>If you hold down the shift key while typing a cursor motion command, the sets the mark before the moving point, so that the region extends from the original position of point to its new position. This feature is referred to as &ldquo;shift-selection&rdquo;. It is similar to text is selected in other editors.</p>

<p>To turn of shift selection, set &lsquo;shift-select-mode&rsquo; to &lsquo;nil&rsquo;</p>

<h2>Disabling transient mark mode<a id="sec-7" name="sec-7"></a></h2>

<p>Setting the mark activates and highlights the region, and is also called as Transient Mark mode. This is a minor mode and is enabled by default. It can be toggled with &rsquo;M-x transient-mark-mode' or with the &lsquo;Active Region Highlighting&rsquo; menu item from the options menu.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Emacs is wonderful for text editing and related stuff with text. It has many modes which helps in editing and managing text, which help increase the productive overall, here I explored some of the major modes and commands which can quickly help for editing text.</p>

<h2>Text Editing in Emacs<a id="sec-1-1" name="sec-1-1"></a></h2>

<p>Emacs has several major modes for handelling text, there is text mode for ordinary text which customizes emacs in small ways for syntactic convention of text. Outline mode provides special commands to handle text, Org Mode extends Outline mode and turns emacs into a full fledged organizer: we can manage TODO Lists, store notes and publish them in many formats and I would speak more about this in my coming days learnings. TeX and LaTeX mode contains embedded commands; HTML mode for HTML and SGML Modes; nxml-mode for XML Mode; Nroff Mode for Groff and Nroff Mode.</p>

<p>It is also possible to edit pictures made out of text characters, also referred as *&ldquo;ASCII art&rdquo;* using Picture mode.</p>

<h2>Words<a id="sec-1-2" name="sec-1-2"></a></h2>

<p>There are several commnads in emacs for operating on words and many of these I have already covered in my Day-1 and Day-4, but let me redo, so I will remeber it for a long time.
Again, the <strong>M</strong> refers the Meta i.e the Alt or Esc key on the keyboard and is followed by the character keys.</p>

<em>4. If we choose there keybindings in our shell <strong>(set -o emacs)</strong>, these word keybindings can help us in moving around the long commands.</em></p>

<h2>Sentences<a id="sec-1-3" name="sec-1-3"></a></h2>

<h3>Quoting from EMACS Manual<a id="sec-1-3-1" name="sec-1-3-1"></a></h3>

<p>#+BEGIN<sub>SRC</sub> Quote
 The sentence commands assume that you follow the American typist&rsquo;s
convention of putting two spaces at the end of a sentence.  That is, a
sentence ends wherever there is a `.&lsquo;, `?&rsquo; or `!&lsquo; followed by the end
of a line or two spaces, with any number of `)&rsquo;, `]&lsquo;, `&rsquo;&lsquo;, or `&ldquo;&rsquo;
characters allowed in between.  A sentence also begins or ends wherever
a paragraph begins or ends.  It is useful to follow this convention,
because it allows the Emacs sentence commands to distinguish between
periods that end a sentence and periods that indicate abbreviations.
\#+END<sub>SRC</sub> Quote</p>

<p><em>NOTE:</em>
<em>1. To use just one space between sentences, set the variable sentence-end-double-space to nil and to make the sentence commands stop for single spaces.</em>
<em>2. The variable sentence-end controls how to recognize the end of the sentence; its value is a regular expression, which is used to match the last few characters of the sentence.</em>
<em>3. Some languages such as Thai, doesn&rsquo;t end with periods; such cases can be handeld by setting variable sentence-end-without-period to t.</em></p>

<h2>Filling Text<a id="sec-1-6" name="sec-1-6"></a></h2>

<p>Filling text means breaking up the lines that fit a specified width. Emacs does the filling in 2 ways. <strong>Auto Fill Mode</strong> inserts text with self-inserting characters and automatically fills it. <strong>Explicit fill Commands</strong>  can be used for editing texts.</p>

<h3>Auto Fill<a id="sec-1-6-1" name="sec-1-6-1"></a></h3>

<p>This is a minor mode in which the lines are broken automatically when they become too wide, breaking up of lines only happens when you type <SPC> or <RET>.</p>

<p>&rsquo;M-x auto-fill-mode' : Toggles the Auto Fill mode.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<SPC>/<RET>&rsquo; : Break lines when appropriate.</p>

<p>From the command line the auto-fill mode enables or disables the mode for current buffer. From LISP <em>auto-fill</em> is enabled when called with omitted or nil argument. for enabling in the major modes, add auto-fill-mode in mode hooks. When the mode it enabled it will show <strong>Fill</strong> in the mode line.</p>

<p>This mode breaks any line which goes longer than the desired width by pressing <SPC> or <RET>, and to insert a SPACE or any newline without breaking the lines tye <strong>C-q <SPC></strong> or <strong>C-q C-j</strong> and <strong>C-o</strong> for inserting new line.</p>

<p>Auto fill mode does not refill the paragraphs; it break lines but does not merge lines, editing in the middle of the paragraph can result in paragraph which is not correctly filled. To fill them correctly we may need to use explicit Fill Commands.</p>

</tbody>
</table>


<p><em>Notes:</em>
<em>1. M-q and fill-region uses the usual emacs criteria for finding paragraph boundaries, which refills everything between point and mark as single paragraph.</em>
<em>2. Numeric argument to <strong>M-q</strong> justifies the text as well as fill it.</em>
<em>3. To Remove extra spaces, use M-q with no argument.</em>
<em>4. The default vault for fill column is 70.</em>
<em>5. <strong>C-x f</strong> (sets-fill-column) sets the numeric value for fill column. With just C-u as argument it sets fill-column to the current horizantal position of point.</em>
<em>6. By default, emacs consider a period followed  by two spaces or by a newline as the end of sentence; a period with just one space will be called as abbrevation and not the end of the sentence.</em>
<em>7. Setting &lsquo;sentence-end-double-space&rsquo; to nil the fill commands will break a line after a period followed by a period and a space.</em></p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p><em>Notes:</em>
<em>1. Move to a line which starts with desired prefix, put point at the end of the prefix and type C-x .</em>
<em>2. To turn off a prefix, specify an empty prefix: type C-x . with point at the beginning of line.</em>
<em>3. The fill prefix is stored in fill-prefix variable. if the value is nil, then there is no fill prefix.</em></p>

<p>This feature allows paragraphs to be filled so each line starts with a special string of characters (such a sequence of spaces, giving and indented paragraph). you can specify fill prefix explicitly; otherwise emacs tries to deduce automatically.</p>

<h3>Adaptive Fill.<a id="sec-1-6-4" name="sec-1-6-4"></a></h3>

<p>The fill command deduce the proper fill prefix for a paragraph automatically in some cases; either white spaces or certain precaution characters at the beginning of line are propagated to all lines of the paragraph.</p>

<p>If the paragraph has two or more lines, the fill prefix is taken from the paragraph&rsquo;s second line, but only if it appears on the first line as well.</p>

<p>If a paragraph has just one line, fill commands <span class="underline">may</span> take a prefix from that line.  The decision is complicated because there are three reasonable things to do in such a case:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use the first line&rsquo;s prefix on all the lines of the paragraph.</p></li>
<li><p>Indent subsequent lines with whitespace, so that they line up under the text that follows the prefix on the first line, but don&rsquo;t actually copy the    <br/>
prefix from the first line.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&rsquo;t do anything special with the second and following lines.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All three of these styles of formatting are commonly used.  So the fill commands try to determine what you would like, based on the prefix that appears and on the major mode.  Here is how.</p>

<p>If the prefix found on the first line matches `adaptive-fill-first-line-regexp', or if it appears to be a comment-starting sequence (this depends on the major mode), then the prefix found is used for filling the paragraph, provided it would not act as a paragraph starter on subsequent lines.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the prefix found is converted to an equivalent number of spaces, and those spaces are used as the fill prefix for the rest of the lines, provided they would not act as a paragraph starter on subsequent lines.</p>

<p>In Text mode, and other modes where only blank lines and page delimiters separate paragraphs, the prefix chosen by adaptive filling never acts as a paragraph starter, so it can always be used for filling.</p>

<p>The variable `adaptive-fill-regexp' determines what kinds of line beginnings can serve as a fill prefix: any characters at the start of the line that match this regular expression are used.  If you set the variable `adaptive-fill-mode' to `nil', the fill prefix is never chosen automatically.</p>

<p>You can specify more complex ways of choosing a fill prefix automatically by setting the variable `adaptive-fill-function' to a function.  This function is called with point after the left margin of a line, and it should return the appropriate fill prefix based on that line.  If it returns `nil', `adaptive-fill-regexp' gets a chance to find a prefix.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em>
<em>1. When a negative argument, the case conversion applies to appropriate no. of words before point, but do not move the point, its convinent if I typed something in wrong case and want to correct the case.</em>
<em>2. In case the command to change case is given in the middle of the word, the case change would happen from the point to the end of the word.</em></p>

<h2>Text Mode<a id="sec-1-8" name="sec-1-8"></a></h2>

<p>This is the major mode for editing the text language, any file ending with .txt will automatically enables this mode; and this mode can also be called by M-x text-mode. Blank lines and page delimiters separate paragraphs, and as a result paragraphs can be indented, and adaptive filling determines what indentation to use when filling a paragraph. The <TAB> usually inserts whitespace up to the next tab stop, instead of indenting the current line.</p>

<p>Text mode turns off comments features except when you explicitly invoke them. It changes so that the single quotes are considered part of the words. But if a word starts with a single quote it is treated as a prefix for the purpose of capitalization. Entering text-mode invokes text-mode-hook.</p>

<h2>Outline Mode<a id="sec-1-9" name="sec-1-9"></a></h2>

<p>This is major mode derived from Text mode, which is specialized for editing outlines; it provides commands to navigate between entries in the outline structure. Type M-x outline-mode to switch to outline mode, entering this mode runs the hook text-mode-hook followed by outline-mode-hook.</p>

<p>When in outline mode use command to make a line invisible it disappears the line and ellipsis(three periods in a row) is displayed at the end of the previous visible line.</p>

<p>Editing command on lines, such as C-n and C-p treat the text of the invisible line as part of the previous visible line.</p>

<p>outline-minor-mode toggle outline minor mode in the current buffer, it is a buffer-local minor mode which provides the same commands as the major mode for the current buffer, this provides special keybindings with C-c prefix, and C-c @ as the prefix in minor-mode.</p>

<h3>Outline Format<a id="sec-1-9-1" name="sec-1-9-1"></a></h3>

<p>Outline mode assumes the the lines in the buffer are of two types:
&ldquo;heading lines&rdquo; and &ldquo;body lines&rdquo;</p>

<p>Heading line: start with one or more asterisk (&lsquo;*&rsquo;); the number of asterisks determines the depth of the heading in the outline structure.
Body Line: Any line which is not a heading line is a body line. Body line belong with a preceding heading line.</p>

<p>A heading line and a body line collectively is called as an entry.</p>

<p>And most of these commands may work differently in org-mode, the org-mode is an advance implementation of outline-mode. I will be writing about this mode in my later days. It may confuse me at a later stage as mainly I use org-mode for my purposes of note taking and writing this blog. Let me provide some brief introduction to the org-mode.</p>

<h2>Org Mode<a id="sec-1-10" name="sec-1-10"></a></h2>

<p>Org mode, as in outline mode, each entry has a heading line that starts with one or more asterisk (*); Any line beginning with a &lsquo;#&rsquo; is considered as a comment. and it also provides commands to view and manipulate the outline structure.</p>

<p>The simplest of these commands is <TAB> (org-cycle). If invoked on heading line, it cycles through different visiblity states of that subtree:
1.  Showing only the heading line.
2.  Show only the heading lines and the heading lines of its direct children.
3.  Show the entire subtree.</p>

<p>The <S-TAB> (org-shifttab) in an org mode cycle visiblity of entire online subtree
1.  Show only top-level heading lines.
2.  Show all heading lines but no body lines.
3.  Show everything.</p>

<p>We can move the entire entry up and down in the buffer, including its body lines and subtree, by typing M-<up> (org-metaup) or M-<down> (org-metadown) on the heading line. Similarly, it can promote or demote the heading line with M-<left> (org-metaleft) and M-&lt;right (org-metaright). For details, The Org Mode Manual.</p>

<h3>Org as an Organizer<a id="sec-1-10-1" name="sec-1-10-1"></a></h3>

<p>You can tag an Org entry as a &ldquo;TODO&rdquo; by typing <strong>C-c C-t</strong> (org-todo) anywhere in the entry. This adds <em>TODO</em> keyword and typing the keyword <strong>C-c C-t</strong> again switches the keyword to <em>DONE</em>; press <strong>C-c C-t</strong> again and it will remove the keyword entirely. They keywords can be customized using the variable &lsquo;org-todo-keywords&rsquo;</p>

<p>With the possiblity of marking an entry as TODO, we can also attach a date to it by typing <strong>C-c C-s</strong> (org-schedule), This prompts for a date by popping a calendar, and then adds the tag &lsquo;SCHEDULED&rsquo;, together with the selected date, beneath the heading line. <strong>C-c C-d</strong> (org-deadline) have the same effect except it adds the tag &lsquo;DEADLINE&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Once you have some planned TODO items, you can add that file to the list of &ldquo;agenda fileS&rdquo; by typing <strong>C-c [</strong> (org-agenda-file-to-front). It allows us to maintain multiple agenda  files. The list of these agenda files are stored in the variable &lsquo;org-agenda-files&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Typing M-x org-agenda lets view items coming from agenda file, this command prompts for what we want to see: a list of things to do this week, a list of TODO items with specific keywords.</p>

<h3>Org as an authoring system<a id="sec-1-10-2" name="sec-1-10-2"></a></h3>

<p>To format org notes nicely and to prepare them for export and publication, <strong>C-c C-e</strong> (org-export) to export buffer and prompts for a export format; includes HTML, LaTeX, OpenDocument(.odt), and PDF.</p>

<p>To export several files at once to a specified directory, either locally or over the network, we can define a list of projects through the variable &lsquo;org-publish-project-alist&rsquo;</p>

<p>Org supports a simple markup scheme for applying text formatting to exported documents:</p>

<ul>
<li>This text is <em>emphasized</em></li>
<li>This text is <strong>in bold</strong></li>
<li>This text is <span class="underline">underlined</span></li>
<li>This text uses <code>a teletype font</code></li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>``This is a quote.&lsquo;&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

<pre><code>This is an example.
</code></pre>

<h2>TeX Mode<a id="sec-1-11" name="sec-1-11"></a></h2>

<p>Emacs provides special major modes for editing files written in TeX and its related formats. TeX is a powerful text formatter written by Donald Knuth; like GNU Emacs. Latex is a simplified input format for TeX implemented using TeX macros. DocTeX is a special file format in which the LateX sources are written, combining sources with documentation.</p>

<p>TeX mode has four variants:
1.  Plain TeX mode
2.  LateX mode.
3.  DocTeX mode.
4.  SliTeX mode.</p>

<p>These distinc major modes differ only slightly, and are designed for editing the four different format. Emacs selects the appropriate mode by looking at the contents of the buffer. Emacs chooses the mode specified by the variable &lsquo;tex-default-mode&rsquo;; its default value is latex-mode. If Emacs doesn&rsquo;t get it right you can select the correct variant of TeX using the command &rsquo;M-x plain-tex-mode', &rsquo;M-x latex-mode', &rsquo;M-x slitex-mode', or &rsquo;M-x doctex-mode'.</p>

<h2>SGML and HTML Modes<a id="sec-1-12" name="sec-1-12"></a></h2>

<p>HTML mode is slightly customizable variant of SGML mode.</p>

<p>There is a major mode for editing XML documents called as nXML mode. This is a mode which can recognize any XML schema and use them to provide completion on XML elements via &rsquo;M-<TAB>, as well as on the fly XML validation with error highlighting. To enable nXML mode for existing buffer type <strong>M-x nxml-mode</strong> or <strong>M-x xml-mode</strong></p>

<p>For files with extension .xml nxml-mode is used by default; and for files with xhtml html-mode is used.</p>

<h2>Nroff mode<a id="sec-1-13" name="sec-1-13"></a></h2>

<p>This is a major mode derived from Text mode and is specialized for editing nroff files e.g. UNIX man pages. <strong>M-x nroff-mode</strong> enters into this mode, and runs the hook &lsquo;text-mode-hook&rsquo;, then &lsquo;nroff-mode-hook&rsquo;; nroff command lines are treated as paragraph separators, pages are separated by &lsquo;.bp&rsquo; commands, and comments start with backslash-doublequote (\&ldquo;)</p>

<p><strong>M-x electric-nroff-mode</strong> toggles the Electric Nroff mode and is a minor-mode and can be used with Nroff mode.</p>

<h2>Enriched Text<a id="sec-1-14" name="sec-1-14"></a></h2>

<p>This is a minor mode for editing formatted text files in a WYSIWYG (&ldquo;what you see is what you get&rdquo;) fashion. When Enriched mode is enabled we can apply various formatting properties to the text in the buffer. This mode is typically used by Text mode and is not compatible with Font Lock Mode which is used by many major modes, for syntax highlighting. When you save a buffer with enriched mode enabled, it is saved using the &lsquo;text/enriched&rsquo; format, including the formatting indentation.</p>

<p>To create a new file of formatted text, visit file and type <strong>M-x enriched-mode</strong></p>

<h2>Editing Text Based Tables<a id="sec-1-15" name="sec-1-15"></a></h2>

<p>The table package provides commands to easily edit the text-based tables. A &ldquo;table&rdquo; consist of t a rectangular text area which is divided into &ldquo;cells&rdquo;. Each cell must be one character wide and one character high, not counting its border lines. A cell can be subdivided into more cells, but they cannot overlap.</p>

<h2>Two column editing<a id="sec-1-16" name="sec-1-16"></a></h2>

<p>Two columns lets you convinently edit two side-by-side columns of text. It uses two side-by-side windows, each showing its own buffer. There are three ways to enter two column mode:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><F2> 2 or C-x 6 2 - Enter two columns mode with the current buffer on the left and on the right, a buffer whose name is based on the current buffer&rsquo;s name.</p></li>
<li><p><F2> s  or C-x 6 s - Split the current buffer, which contains two column text, into two buffers and display them side by side.</p></li>
<li><p><F2> b BUFFER <RET> or C-x 6 b BUFFER <RET> - Enter two columns mode using the current buffer as the left-hand buffer, and using buffer BUFFER as the right-hand buffer.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sixth day of writing my content, I had never thought i would be even writing for this many posts continuously(I am kind of a lazy writer) and I realize this experience of writing blogs and sharing my learnings or acquired knowledge is actually encouraging. I started to think that if I am able to put some extra time and effort, I may also complete a lot of things by taking similar challenegs. My priority ones are loosing weight(I am still finding myself in tough situation on to get myself motivated) and learning the python programming language, which as I had been told is pretty easy to learning. I may get inconsistent at times due to other priorities coming up, but writing my learnings and posting everyday keeps me motivated and keep reminiding me I have pending stuff to do.</p>

<p>Every emacs command has a name which can be used against the convenient key bindings. Most emacs commands doesn&rsquo;t have key bindings so the only way to learn them is to use them as commands, by emacs convention all the command will consist one or more words separated  by &lsquo;-&rsquo;. For eg. auto-fill-mode or manual-entry. So to enter a command, type M-x enter the command name RET (to execute), C-g (to cancel). Its something similar to what we discussed in our Day 5, to enter the mini-buffer run the command and execute it and it does work similar for completion as it is to be done in mini-buffer.</p>

<p>well there are many things which we need immediately and overlook to take the effort to read the manual, or say for LISP errors which we might not be aware of, the freenode.org IRC network&rsquo;s #emacs channel is the best place after failed attempt of finding any help on google and emacswiki.org. but again at the same time emacs itself has a very awesome online documentation for reference. Online means it is accessible within emacs all the time. The help commands are easily accessible with &lsquo;C-h&rsquo; help character, after this we usually put the character for which we are seeking help and can be canceled the same way as all the mini-buffers. &lsquo;C-h&rsquo; itself a help option, so typing &lsquo;C-h C-h&rsquo; will print the available help characters. Apart from C-h, F1 can also  be used. I have put some simple stuff about how to ask help in Emacs at &lt;<a id="put-the-link-here" name="put-the-link-here"></a>. A more detailed list s below.</p>

<p>Similarly apropos are the commands which may answer certain questions as &ldquo;what are the commands for working with files?&rdquo;. specifying a apropos pattern such as a word, a list of words, or regular expressions, each apropos command display a list of item that matches the pattern in a separate window.</p>

<p>I just completed through the help documentation in emacs manual, and I am convinced the emacs has got the most extensive documentation an editor could ever have, the above table tries to cover as many things as possible but I am pretty sure, I would have definitely missed things, like this that once on IRC I had been suggested some lisp code to quickly take me to the help page and I missed it. Well, on many modern keyboards F1 as well works to call the help function.</p>

<p>While doing the typing I do make a lot of mistakes and undo is the most fundamental command for correcting the mistakes. C-/ does the same trick as C-x u and C-_ all meant to undo my work. If you see the buffers have been modified accidentaly, the easiest way is to press <strong>C-/</strong> repetadely unless the stars disappears from the mod line. Just press <strong>C-/</strong> to see the last change, so that we can understand if the change was intentional, if yes then we can leave it like this, if no then we can undo by pressing <strong>C-/</strong> repeatedly.</p>

<p>Its much easier to transpose characters in emacs using *C-t*(transpose-chars)  and transpose words using *M-t*(transpose-words) and moves the word containing or preceding point forward as tell, though it does not move any punctutation mark, for eg, FOO, BAR will become BAR, FOO. *C-M-t*(transpose-sexps) is similar to transposing two expressions and *C-x C-t*(transpose-lines) for transposing lines. The numeric command works here, it tell the transpose command to move forward the character before or containing point across several other characters.</p>

<p><strong>M&#x2013; M-l</strong> Convert last word to lower-case, it is Meta-Minus. <strong>M&#x2013; M-u</strong> Convert last word to uppercase. <strong>M&#x2013; M-c</strong> convert last word to lowercase with capital letters.</p>

<p>The spell checking ability of any editor should be good for the writer to help check spells on the fly, and emacs does have some nifty commands to do that as well. We need aspell, ispell, hunspell installed on the system for these commands to work. Once started the programs continue to run so that subsequent spell check commands complete more quickly and can be killed using <strong>M-x ispell-kill-ispell</strong> but is not required as it does not uses much memory and only active when spelling correcting is done, these programs using two dictionaries one is the standard dictionary and the other is our defined dictionary. The local dictionary can be defined by &ldquo;ispell-local-dictionary* or if nil by "ispell-dictionary&rdquo; or if both is nil then the default dictinary is selected. The variable &ldquo;ispell-complete-word-dict&rdquo; specifies the file name for its dictionary and is used for word completion. Flyspell mode is fully automatic mode of checking the words in the buffer as we insert them or edit them, when it finds the words it doesn&rsquo;t recognize it highlights that word. Right now I am seeing my buffer so colorful, thanks to flyspell mode, and my typing :). <strong>M-x flyspell-mode</strong> toggles the flyspell mode, to turn on flyspell mode for all text buffer <strong>turn-on-flyspell-mode</strong> to <strong>text-mode-hook</strong>.</p>

<p>Well. I am done for the Day 6, being emacs is such a vast entity as an editor, i spend most of my time going through the help document and manual pages only and enable myself to write quality content, which should help me or any one else who might want to use my content for his/her reference. I am still at a very primitive level of doing things with emacs, but I am aware I am still to young here. I will put these text on git hub as well, for anyone to help me correcting the content or if adding anything more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Emacs have a minibuffer, and called the same because of its small screen space, the minibuffer resides in the same area as echo area so many time when any error or informative message appear in the echo area, it just hides the minibuffer for a few seconds or till the time any new keypress is made.</p>

<p>Minibuffer can be activated using typing text to it, and exited by typing <strong><RET></strong> (execute the command) or <strong>C-g</strong> (cancel the command). The minibuffer prompt shows the default arguments suppose the commands that read buffer names usually show buffer name as the default and can be activated using <strong><RET></strong></p>

<p>When finding a file in emacs, for opening or creating one, the minibuffer usually open the default dir, the default directory is stored in buffer-local variable as &lsquo;default-directory&rsquo;, now whenever emacs will read a filename using a minibuffer it will insert the directory name of the file being opened.</p>

<p>Emacs interpret &lsquo;~/&rsquo; as your home directory. you can specify something like this in case you do not want to type the complete path from where you want your files to be opened / created.</p>

<p>The minibuffer in emacs is also a buffer and the usual emacs commands are available for editing. <strong><RET></strong> in the minibuffer submits the argument and the same cannot be used to insert a new line and can be done with <strong>C-q C-j</strong> and <strong>C-o</strong>. The keys <TAB>, <SPC>, and ? are bound to completion of the commands.</p>

<p>When the minibuffer is active, the echo area is treated like an ordinary Emacs window.</p>

<p>Minibuffer uses a feature called as completion these(<TAB>, <RET> and <SPC>) commands attempt to complete the text in the minibuffer, &lsquo;?&rsquo; usually provide a list of possible completions. These commands work by narrowing down a large list of to a smaller subsets of matches. Emacs perform completion using one or more of the below <em>Completion Styles</em>.</p>

<p>The variable  <span class="underline">completion styles</span> specify the completion style to use.</p>

<p>From the Emacs Manual:</p>

<p>M-x uses the minibuffer to read the name of a command, so completion works by matching the minibuffer text with available emacs commands.</p>

<p>THe commands for completion works as defined in the minibuffer when the completion is allowed.</p>

<p><strong><TAB></strong>     complete as much as possible; if unable to complete display a list of possible completions (minibuffer-complete)</p>

<p><strong><SPC></strong>     Completes up to one word. (minibuffer-complete-word)</p>

<p><strong><RET></strong>     Submit the minibuffer text as argument. (minibuffer-complete-and-exit)</p>

<p><strong>?</strong>         Display list of completions. (minibuffer-complete-help)</p>

<p><strong>Mouse-1</strong>   Clicking mouse button 1 or 2 on a completion alternative chooses it
<strong>Mouse-2</strong>   (mouse-choose-completion).</p>

<p><strong>M-v</strong>       Selects the window showing the completion list. (switch-to-completion)
<strong><PageUp></strong>  and then we can use the below pageup and prior commands.
<strong><prior></strong></p>

<p><strong><Right></strong>    (next-completion) this moves to point following alternatives.</p>

<p><strong><Left></strong>    (previous-completion) this moves to previous alternatives.</p>

<p>There are many modes in emacs which let you do so many things with the minibuffer, some noted ones are ido-mode and helm-mode.</p>

<p>Ido mode is part of the emacs from version 22.</p>

<p>I will cover these modes in my later learnings, and keep updating.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am  becoming such an inconsistent learner and writer and have been not being able to post any new learnings a from last 4 days for emacs, but sometimes the work just take over us and do not allow any bandwidth, this really could be a lame excuse, but my sincerely I should be keeping my posts regular.</p>

<p>Again, it&rsquo;s more the like learning from your (in this case my) mistakes and going through your work again and again it&rsquo;s a way of reorganising your work and fixing it wherever necessary, I would also need help to understanding the mistakes we should avoid overlooking while technical writing or a posting on a blog.</p>

<h2>What new there could be there inserting text, believe me, emacs is pandora box for writers and enthusiasts.</h2>

<p>There is so much written in the #emacs manual <code>C-h r</code>, and this time it was the keys <code>C-q</code> or <code>C-x 8</code> this is used to print literals or Unicode characters by specifying their Hex or octal code. For eg, we have a key on keyboard as &lsquo;Del&rsquo; which is used to delete the character  on the point and move backward(from right to left, when the text displays from left to right or otherwise in case text being displayed the other way). The C-q combination when pressed will make the delete key type type the literal &lsquo;DEL&rsquo; instead of acting as text eraser, and the same goes for RET, when you press RET(RETURN or ENTER on some keyboard) we get RET as the literal. But really I want to insert a blank line could it be C-\n (new line character), well that is going to be a cryptic I am sure emacs doesn&rsquo;t treat it&rsquo;s commands this way and I can simply press <strong>C-o</strong> and similarly <strong>C-x C-o</strong> delete all but the last blank line, good gracious I was too fed up with doing C-k to delete my empty lines :) and similarly <strong>C-j</strong> is for entering a new line.</p>

<p>I want to count the no of words in my selected region or in the buffer, M-= and C-u M-= comes to the rescue. The latter would count the no. of words in the buffer. The command C-x = would do the display the information for my cursor position. Quoting from the emacs manual.</p>

<p>We can also move around the buffer with providing the numeric argument, the most simpler is to use the &lsquo;Meta&rsquo; command with the no. The keys M-1, M-2 as well as M&#x2013; are bound to commands (digit-argument and negative-argument) and set up argument for the next command.</p>

<p>For example I want to go down by 5 lines</p>

<p>M-5 C-n</p>

<p>I was just wondering now what if I want to write 5 o&rsquo;s in line, well thats another question to worry why I would like to do, but how to do in Emacs, and well M-5 0 C-n is not going to do this(i.e. insert 5 0 and go to next line). So, to achieve this  press <strong>M-5 C-u 0</strong> does the trick. We now know there is another way of inserting a <em>Numeric Argument</em> and that is using <strong>C-u</strong>, but when type alone it does have its own special meaning of 4 characters. &lsquo;C-u C-u C-f&rsquo; will move you 16 characters, &lsquo;C-u C-u C-o&rsquo; will make a lot of blank lines, and C-u C-k will kill 4 lines. :)</p>

<p>It would be good to know that emacs is powerful to repeat commands as well, the way it worked in Shell, but I think its pretty ahead of its time, and in one command itself you can ensure you can repeat the command as many times as you want. The trick is to use <strong>C-x z</strong>, if I have used a command &lsquo;C-u 2 0 C-d&rsquo; to delete 20 characters, we can repeat this same command using &lsquo;C-x z&rsquo; and insert &lsquo;z&rsquo; as many times you want to run the previous command. cool. For deleting 100 chars I may need to write like &lsquo;C-x z z z z z&rsquo; should remove 100 characters. <em>Note: this command will not change the arguments in the previous command</em></p>

<p>So we checked out the below in commands today.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>The windows and the buffer.<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a></h1>

<p>I will touch upon one new topic and what I learned today. While writing my <a href="http://www.omps.in/blog/2015/11/14/day-2-the-real-estate/">Day 2</a> article I learnt intersting usage of windows and frames (well, the one where we do our editing and writing stuff. It would be good to understand how opening emacs creates the frame and window within.)</p>

<p>We start emacs the same way we start our other application. (on Linux, by typing on the terminal window; on Windows and Mac, clicking on to the application icon.) When emacs starts up it usually display a special buffer name <strong>GNU Emacs</strong>. This contains information about emacs and links to common good stuff for begineers(in later days we will figure out how we can skip this)</p>

<p>It is good not to start multiple emacs session, instead just start once and do all the editing in the same sessions. In this way the emacs context accumlates valuable context, such as kill ring, registers, undo history, which helps a lot at advanced stages.</p>

<h2>Buffer<a id="sec-1-1" name="sec-1-1"></a></h2>

<p>The text we are going to edit in emacs is called as buffers and is used to hold the files text. So everytime we visit a file, run dired, send message with &lsquo;C-x m&rsquo; or ask for help, a buffer is used for holding the text of the message.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h4>The Emacs Real estate.</h4>

<p>This is about the screen organization of emacs, how the text is placed and how the screen is drawn for the editor, this is about telling you how the things in #emacs as they are, and why they are important this way. Though, i should have started understanding it and writng it down on Day 1, but understanding the key contol is equally important to me, if I did not had learned about it, I surely would have faced difficulty closing my emacs and moving around. Now let me just try to see how much I  am understanding about the screen here and how well I can put it in my words. :) ofcourse it is not a tech doc, but this my 30 Days challenege to learn more about emacs and understand emacs for good.</p>

<p>I would be mainly using a lot of images compared to lot of writing that, understanding the screen can better be understood by rightly poining to the correct area.</p>

<h5>The Screen</h5>

<p>Double clicking on the emacs icon does open up a GUI window and similarly typing it on command prompt from withing an X Windows system, I get the emacs as an editor with full flesh and bones, i actually means as an GUI application, like we see for other editors. And when  I do same while I am  on the command prompt with no X support, or with -nw or -t (with emacsclient, will write more about this in coming days.) i get the emacs taking up my entire terminal screen. We will call these frames and emace behaves almost similar in both these frames. It normally starts with just one frame, but many frames can be created.</p>

<p>Each frame consist of several distinct regions. as shown in the picture below.</p>

<p>The emacs frame consist of these important segments</p>

<h6>Point: Where editing takes place</h6>

<p>The place where the cusrsor is present is called as the point in a multiple windows emacs in GUI, the point can be moved by clicking the mouse in the respective region, the active window will have the curson as solid block and will appear to be on the cursor. While working with several buffers each buffer has its own valur for point.</p>

<h6>Echo area: Where the commands and messages appear at bottom of the frame.</h6>

<p>if you pause for more than a second in the middle of the command, you can see your commands being echoed in the echo area. it also shows you the error message when the command fails. The messages displayed in the echo area are generally saved in the special buffer calles as <strong>Messages</strong></p>

<h6>Mode Line: Understanding the mode line.</h6>

<p>At the bottom of every window there is a mode line.
The text displayed on the mode line has the following format
cs:ch-fr buf        pos line (major minor)</p>

<p>o cs  display the character set.</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left">'-'</td>
<td class="left">implicate no special character set.  see [Coding System](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Coding-Systems)</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="left">'='</td>
<td class="left">means no coversion, and used for files with no textual data</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="left">'1'</td>
<td class="left">ISO Latin-1, other characters represent various coding system</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>o ch   this usually show 2 dashes</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left">(&#x2013;)</td>
<td class="left">if the buffer is unmodified.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="left">(\*\*)</td>
<td class="left">if the buffer is modified.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="left">'%\*'</td>
<td class="left">for read only buffer if modified.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="left">'%%'</td>
<td class="left">otherwise, i.e read only buffer and not modified.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="left">'-'</td>
<td class="left">displayed after ch, if the directory is local.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="left">'@'</td>
<td class="left">if the directory if buffer is on remote macine is shows @.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>o fr   is the selected frame name, default is F1</p>

<p>o buf   usually the name of the file or the buffer.</p>

<p>o pos   where there is additional text above the top of the window or below the bottom.</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left">All</td>
<td class="left">In case of small buffer and everything visible on screen</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="left">Top</td>
<td class="left">If you are at the beginning of the buffer</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="left">Bot</td>
<td class="left">If you are at the bottom of the buffer</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="left">nn%</td>
<td class="left">nn is the percentage of buffer above the window</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>o line   &lsquo;L&rsquo; Followed by the line no. at point.</p>

<p>o major   Name of the major mode used in buffer, for eg. Text mode, Lisp Mode, Org Mode and so on.</p>

<p>o minor   minor mode are the list of enabled minor modes on top of major mode, for eg visual-line-mode, flyspell-mode</p>

<h6>The Menu Bar - How to use.</h6>

<p>On the graphical display you can just use the mouse to open the menu bar, an arrow to the right of the menu denotes the menu having a sub menu. Many commands in menu bar have ordinary key bindings as well.</p>

<p>On a text terminal menu bar can be opened using &rsquo;M-`&lsquo; or <F10>, or run the command tmm-menubar. Move around the menu bar using up and down arrow key, <RET> i.e enter key, to select the item or C-g to come out of the menu bar mode.</p>

<p>I know its been a little late today, but I was quite able to give time one weekends than as on weekdays, I just don&rsquo;t want to loose focus so am trying to keep up with my posts daily, hope these should be helpful, and I am seriously looking forward for your comments and suggestion, so do please keep posting, tomorrow I think I will go more about buffers and frames.</p>

<p>All in all I am enjoying and learning so many things while posting and writing.</p>

<p>Quoting from Emacs Manual
&ldquo; Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emacs is an advanced editor because of its ability to perform complex operations related to OS, by controlling subprocesses, indenting programs automatically, showing multiple files at once and ofcourse we can use it as text editor.
It is also a self-documenting means any time special command for help can be used for finding out what the particular command does.
Emacs can be eaisly altered to behave in certain prefrence and is highly customizable.
Emacs can go beyond simple customisation and can create entirely new commands. These new commands are simple program written in LISP.</p>

<h4>Downloading<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a></h4>

<ul>
<li>Downloaded Emacs: I downloaded for MAC OS X from <a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/">http://emacsformacosx.com/</a>. I had been suggested by many sites and also from the people on IRC #emacs channel, while you are learning to use emacs, do not start with a customised emacs. I believe it could be mainly because a lot of customisations are already done for you, hence limiting you learning curve. Well, downloading and installing with OS X is pretty simple and straight, I got &ldquo;Emacs Version 24.3 Universal Binary Released 2013-03-11&rdquo;. Double click on the installer and voilla the installation is completed on the fly.</li>
</ul>


<p>For windows and Linux you can download GNU Emacs releases from a <a href="http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/emacs/">nearby GNU mirror</a>; or if automatic redirection does not work see the list of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html">GNU mirrors</a>, or use the main <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs">GNU ftp server</a>.</p>

<p>GNU Emacs development is hosted on <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs/">savannah.gnu.org</a>.</p>

<h4>Working with emacs<a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a></h4>

<ul>
<li>Starting the editor: once downloaded and installed. From the Launchpad -> emacs, clicking on which took me to the editor in its full glory, with a nice welcome message with link to the manual and the beginner emacs tutorials to get a start working with emacs and to quickly get help in emacs &ldquo;C-h (Hold down Ctrl and Press h)</li>
</ul>


<h5>Few things to note and which is global to emacs.<a id="sec-2-1" name="sec-2-1"></a></h5>

<p>Control Key in emacs is denoted as &lsquo;C&rsquo;.
All or Esc Key in emacs is denoted as &rsquo;M' or referred in document as meta key.
Shift will be denoted as &rsquo;S'.</p>

<h5>Moving around<a id="sec-2-2" name="sec-2-2"></a></h5>

<p>Most movements in emacs can be controlled using the arrow keys but some still say it is not advisable and use of key sequences controled by Ctrl and Meta keys are advisable. below table helps in understanding the movements with these keys.</p>

<p>These are some of the common keys for moving around while in emacs. It seems its really hard for getting used to it, but as I am working with emacs for sometime, I started to feel it is most obvious to be like that.</p>

<p>I think most of the time as a beginner we could get along with using the arrow keys and we should highly discourage it and use the emacs specific keybindings to move around within emacs. Apart from bringing the emacs on and starting it up, the very important thing we should remeber is how to close it. During my initial days as emacs user I was not aware of quitting emacs, and have of the time ended in killing emacs from the process tree, now I feel so stupid. C-g and C-x C-c are the commands, which can help you all the time, while we are learning. I have heard more advanced user of emacs seldom close their emacs sessions and I may try to forget using C-x C-C again. It may take some time till I get there and stop closing my emacs and I am sure it would be more than 30 days.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h5>Applications for Kids.</h5>

<p>I was trying to figure out some application/games for kids based on Linux to teach my Kid about some programming, I tried to teach him some computer at times and found him very interested in leaning stuff. There must be many for windows but being myself an avid Linux user from quite a long time, I really want to introduce him to Linux quite early, unlike me, who got my hands on Linux late in life and still waiting to explore the endless possiblities it offers.<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a></p>

<p>There will always be these question, 1. Why computers? and 2. Why to kids? 3. Are they are smart enough to handle computers.</p>

<p>We have very common non-sensical answers or myths around which may suggest the Computers are only for grown ups and kids might not be able to handle the strain it may cause to their eyes, yes in this case I do agree, and hence we need to understand to limit their onscreen time; but doing this also we can ensure to learn our kids about computers.</p>

<p>Here is a list of few application which I was able to collate using the net and ofcoure google.com :)</p>

<h6><a href="http://gcompris.net/index-en.html">Gcompris</a> :<a id="sec-1-0-1" name="sec-1-0-1"></a></h6>

<p>Gcompris is a suite of around 100 games with different difficulty levels suited for kids between age 2-10, The activities are divided up between sections such as Math, Reading, Amusement. The entire suite is available on most of the distributions standard repostiries. Gcompris is a free software, which means I can adapt it, change it, improve it and most importantly can share this among thousands of other childrens who might want to use it. Below are some of the things Gcompris is offering.</p>

<ul>
<li>Computer discovery: keyboard, mouse, different mouse gestures, &#x2026;</li>
<li>arithmetic: table memory, enumeration, double entry table, mirror image, &#x2026;</li>
<li>science: the canal lock, the water cycle, the submarine, electric simulation &#x2026;</li>
<li>geography: place the country on the map</li>
<li>games: chess, memory, connect 4, oware, sudoku &#x2026;</li>
<li>reading: reading practice</li>
<li>other: learn to tell time, puzzle of famous paintings, vector drawing, cartoon making, &#x2026;</li>
</ul>


<p>More information on this project can be found at <a href="http://gcompris.net/index-en.html">Gcompris Website</a>. And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCompris">Gcompris Wikipedia</a> does has a simple overview of this project too.</p>

<p>On debian or debian alike systems, use</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install gcompris
</code></pre>

<h6><a href="http://tux4kids.alioth.debian.org/">Tux4Kids</a><a id="sec-1-0-2" name="sec-1-0-2"></a></h6>

<li><p>Tuxpaint</p>

<p>There is a little painintg program to make your kid learn paint. This lets kids draw things and is good for them to learn moving the mouse and do other stuff. his remarkable drawing program empowers kids to be creative in an environment complete with magic tools and sound effects.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install tuxpaint
</code></pre>

<p>for other installation instrcutions can be found at <a href="http://www.tuxpaint.org/download/">http://www.tuxpaint.org/download/</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>TuxMath</p>

<p>Lets kids hone their arithmetic skills while they defend penguins from incoming comets, or offers them a chance to explore the asteroid belt with only their factoring abilities to bring them through safely</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install tuxmath
</code></pre>

<p>for other installation instrcutions can be found at <a href="http://tux4kids.alioth.debian.org/tuxmath/download.php">http://tux4kids.alioth.debian.org/tuxmath/download.php</a></p>

<p>I think for the beginning I will just go ahead and start with this.  May be when I have to teach him further about programming, I have my list complete with Scratch, Alice and Shoes which may help me if required in the next coming years.</p>

<p>BTW, forgot to mention there are real good linux distributions just aimed for kids, and may help kids learn a lot of things on their own while managing their own personal latops. The above utilities are good if you have only one machine and you want your kid to allow to use these too.</p>

<p>There are also articles for making to learn kids to program at <a href="http://archive09.linux.com/feature/155203">linux.com</a>. Some of them mentioned are scratch, Alice and Shoes.</p></li>
