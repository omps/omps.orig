    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am  becoming such an inconsistent learner and writer and have been not being able to post any new learnings a from last 4 days for emacs, but sometimes the work just take over us and do not allow any bandwidth, this really could be a lame excuse, but my sincerely I should be keeping my posts regular.</p>

<p>Again, it&rsquo;s more the like learning from your (in this case my) mistakes and going through your work again and again it&rsquo;s a way of reorganising your work and fixing it wherever necessary, I would also need help to understanding the mistakes we should avoid overlooking while technical writing or a posting on a blog.</p>

<h2>What new there could be there inserting text, believe me, emacs is pandora box for writers and enthusiasts.</h2>

<p>There is so much written in the #emacs manual <code>C-h r</code>, and this time it was the keys <code>C-q</code> or <code>C-x 8</code> this is used to print literals or Unicode characters by specifying their Hex or octal code. For eg, we have a key on keyboard as &lsquo;Del&rsquo; which is used to delete the character  on the point and move backward(from right to left, when the text displays from left to right or otherwise in case text being displayed the other way). The C-q combination when pressed will make the delete key type type the literal &lsquo;DEL&rsquo; instead of acting as text eraser, and the same goes for RET, when you press RET(RETURN or ENTER on some keyboard) we get RET as the literal. But really I want to insert a blank line could it be C-\n (new line character), well that is going to be a cryptic I am sure emacs doesn&rsquo;t treat it&rsquo;s commands this way and I can simply press <strong>C-o</strong> and similarly <strong>C-x C-o</strong> delete all but the last blank line, good gracious I was too fed up with doing C-k to delete my empty lines :) and similarly <strong>C-j</strong> is for entering a new line.</p>

<p>I want to count the no of words in my selected region or in the buffer, M-= and C-u M-= comes to the rescue. The latter would count the no. of words in the buffer. The command C-x = would do the display the information for my cursor position. Quoting from the emacs manual.</p>

<p>We can also move around the buffer with providing the numeric argument, the most simpler is to use the &lsquo;Meta&rsquo; command with the no. The keys M-1, M-2 as well as M&#x2013; are bound to commands (digit-argument and negative-argument) and set up argument for the next command.</p>

<p>For example I want to go down by 5 lines</p>

<p>M-5 C-n</p>

<p>I was just wondering now what if I want to write 5 o&rsquo;s in line, well thats another question to worry why I would like to do, but how to do in Emacs, and well M-5 0 C-n is not going to do this(i.e. insert 5 0 and go to next line). So, to achieve this  press <strong>M-5 C-u 0</strong> does the trick. We now know there is another way of inserting a <em>Numeric Argument</em> and that is using <strong>C-u</strong>, but when type alone it does have its own special meaning of 4 characters. &lsquo;C-u C-u C-f&rsquo; will move you 16 characters, &lsquo;C-u C-u C-o&rsquo; will make a lot of blank lines, and C-u C-k will kill 4 lines. :)</p>

<p>It would be good to know that emacs is powerful to repeat commands as well, the way it worked in Shell, but I think its pretty ahead of its time, and in one command itself you can ensure you can repeat the command as many times as you want. The trick is to use <strong>C-x z</strong>, if I have used a command &lsquo;C-u 2 0 C-d&rsquo; to delete 20 characters, we can repeat this same command using &lsquo;C-x z&rsquo; and insert &lsquo;z&rsquo; as many times you want to run the previous command. cool. For deleting 100 chars I may need to write like &lsquo;C-x z z z z z&rsquo; should remove 100 characters. <em>Note: this command will not change the arguments in the previous command</em></p>

<p>So we checked out the below in commands today.</p>

    <updated>2015-11-23T20:06:40+05:30</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>The windows and the buffer.<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a></h1>

<p>I will touch upon one new topic and what I learned today. While writing my <a href="http://www.omps.in/blog/2015/11/14/day-2-the-real-estate/">Day 2</a> article I learnt intersting usage of windows and frames (well, the one where we do our editing and writing stuff. It would be good to understand how opening emacs creates the frame and window within.)</p>

<p>We start emacs the same way we start our other application. (on Linux, by typing on the terminal window; on Windows and Mac, clicking on to the application icon.) When emacs starts up it usually display a special buffer name <strong>GNU Emacs</strong>. This contains information about emacs and links to common good stuff for begineers(in later days we will figure out how we can skip this)</p>

<p>It is good not to start multiple emacs session, instead just start once and do all the editing in the same sessions. In this way the emacs context accumlates valuable context, such as kill ring, registers, undo history, which helps a lot at advanced stages.</p>

<h2>Buffer<a id="sec-1-1" name="sec-1-1"></a></h2>

<p>The text we are going to edit in emacs is called as buffers and is used to hold the files text. So everytime we visit a file, run dired, send message with &lsquo;C-x m&rsquo; or ask for help, a buffer is used for holding the text of the message.</p>

    <link href="http://www.omps.in/blog/2015/11/14/day-2-the-real-estate/"/>
    <updated>2015-11-14T00:31:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://www.omps.in/blog/2015/11/14/day-2-the-real-estate</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>The Emacs Real estate.</h4>

<p>This is about the screen organization of emacs, how the text is placed and how the screen is drawn for the editor, this is about telling you how the things in #emacs as they are, and why they are important this way. Though, i should have started understanding it and writng it down on Day 1, but understanding the key contol is equally important to me, if I did not had learned about it, I surely would have faced difficulty closing my emacs and moving around. Now let me just try to see how much I  am understanding about the screen here and how well I can put it in my words. :) ofcourse it is not a tech doc, but this my 30 Days challenege to learn more about emacs and understand emacs for good.</p>

<p>I would be mainly using a lot of images compared to lot of writing that, understanding the screen can better be understood by rightly poining to the correct area.</p>

<h5>The Screen</h5>

<p>Double clicking on the emacs icon does open up a GUI window and similarly typing it on command prompt from withing an X Windows system, I get the emacs as an editor with full flesh and bones, i actually means as an GUI application, like we see for other editors. And when  I do same while I am  on the command prompt with no X support, or with -nw or -t (with emacsclient, will write more about this in coming days.) i get the emacs taking up my entire terminal screen. We will call these frames and emace behaves almost similar in both these frames. It normally starts with just one frame, but many frames can be created.</p>

<p>Each frame consist of several distinct regions. as shown in the picture below.</p>

<p>The emacs frame consist of these important segments</p>

<h6>Point: Where editing takes place</h6>

<p>The place where the cusrsor is present is called as the point in a multiple windows emacs in GUI, the point can be moved by clicking the mouse in the respective region, the active window will have the curson as solid block and will appear to be on the cursor. While working with several buffers each buffer has its own valur for point.</p>

<h6>Echo area: Where the commands and messages appear at bottom of the frame.</h6>

<p>if you pause for more than a second in the middle of the command, you can see your commands being echoed in the echo area. it also shows you the error message when the command fails. The messages displayed in the echo area are generally saved in the special buffer calles as <strong>Messages</strong></p>

<h6>Mode Line: Understanding the mode line.</h6>

<p>At the bottom of every window there is a mode line.
The text displayed on the mode line has the following format
cs:ch-fr buf        pos line (major minor)</p>

<p>o cs  display the character set.</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left">'-'</td>

<td class="left">'='</td>
<td class="left">means no coversion, and used for files with no textual data</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="left">'1'</td>
<td class="left">ISO Latin-1, other characters represent various coding system</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>o ch   this usually show 2 dashes</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left">(&#x2013;)</td>
<td class="left">if the buffer is unmodified.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="left">(\*\*)</td>
<td class="left">if the buffer is modified.</td>

</tr>


<tr>
<td class="left">'@'</td>
<td class="left">if the directory if buffer is on remote macine is shows @.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>o fr   is the selected frame name, default is F1</p>

<p>o buf   usually the name of the file or the buffer.</p>

<p>o pos   where there is additional text above the top of the window or below the bottom.</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left">All</td>
<td class="left">In case of small buffer and everything visible on screen</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="left">Top</td>
<td class="left">If you are at the beginning of the buffer</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="left">Bot</td>
<td class="left">If you are at the bottom of the buffer</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="left">nn%</td>
<td class="left">nn is the percentage of buffer above the window</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>o line   &lsquo;L&rsquo; Followed by the line no. at point.</p>

<p>o major   Name of the major mode used in buffer, for eg. Text mode, Lisp Mode, Org Mode and so on.</p>

<p>o minor   minor mode are the list of enabled minor modes on top of major mode, for eg visual-line-mode, flyspell-mode</p>

<h6>The Menu Bar - How to use.</h6>

<p>On the graphical display you can just use the mouse to open the menu bar, an arrow to the right of the menu denotes the menu having a sub menu. Many commands in menu bar have ordinary key bindings as well.</p>

<p>On a text terminal menu bar can be opened using &rsquo;M-`&lsquo; or <F10>, or run the command tmm-menubar. Move around the menu bar using up and down arrow key, <RET> i.e enter key, to select the item or C-g to come out of the menu bar mode.</p>

<p>I know its been a little late today, but I was quite able to give time one weekends than as on weekdays, I just don&rsquo;t want to loose focus so am trying to keep up with my posts daily, hope these should be helpful, and I am seriously looking forward for your comments and suggestion, so do please keep posting, tomorrow I think I will go more about buffers and frames.</p>

<p>All in all I am enjoying and learning so many things while posting and writing.</p>

    <link href="http://www.omps.in/blog/2015/11/14/day-1-learning-emacs/"/>
    <updated>2015-11-14T00:02:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://www.omps.in/blog/2015/11/14/day-1-learning-emacs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thank you for your support and encouragement. So here I am writing about my beginning of Day 1: part and working with EMACS.</p>

<p>Quoting from Emacs Manual
&ldquo; Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emacs is an advanced editor because of its ability to perform complex operations related to OS, by controlling subprocesses, indenting programs automatically, showing multiple files at once and ofcourse we can use it as text editor.
It is also a self-documenting means any time special command for help can be used for finding out what the particular command does.
Emacs can be eaisly altered to behave in certain prefrence and is highly customizable.
Emacs can go beyond simple customisation and can create entirely new commands. These new commands are simple program written in LISP.</p>

<h4>Downloading<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a></h4>

<ul>
<li>Downloaded Emacs: I downloaded for MAC OS X from <a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/">http://emacsformacosx.com/</a>. I had been suggested by many sites and also from the people on IRC #emacs channel, while you are learning to use emacs, do not start with a customised emacs. I believe it could be mainly because a lot of customisations are already done for you, hence limiting you learning curve. Well, downloading and installing with OS X is pretty simple and straight, I got &ldquo;Emacs Version 24.3 Universal Binary Released 2013-03-11&rdquo;. Double click on the installer and voilla the installation is completed on the fly.</li>
</ul>


<p>For windows and Linux you can download GNU Emacs releases from a <a href="http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/emacs/">nearby GNU mirror</a>; or if automatic redirection does not work see the list of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html">GNU mirrors</a>, or use the main <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs">GNU ftp server</a>.</p>

<p>GNU Emacs development is hosted on <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs/">savannah.gnu.org</a>.</p>

<h4>Working with emacs<a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a></h4>

<ul>
<li>Starting the editor: once downloaded and installed. From the Launchpad -> emacs, clicking on which took me to the editor in its full glory, with a nice welcome message with link to the manual and the beginner emacs tutorials to get a start working with emacs and to quickly get help in emacs &ldquo;C-h (Hold down Ctrl and Press h)</li>
</ul>


<h5>Few things to note and which is global to emacs.<a id="sec-2-1" name="sec-2-1"></a></h5>

<p>Control Key in emacs is denoted as &lsquo;C&rsquo;.
All or Esc Key in emacs is denoted as &rsquo;M' or referred in document as meta key.
Shift will be denoted as &rsquo;S'.</p>

<h5>Moving around<a id="sec-2-2" name="sec-2-2"></a></h5>

<p>Most movements in emacs can be controlled using the arrow keys but some still say it is not advisable and use of key sequences controled by Ctrl and Meta keys are advisable. below table helps in understanding the movements with these keys.</p>

<p>These are some of the common keys for moving around while in emacs. It seems its really hard for getting used to it, but as I am working with emacs for sometime, I started to feel it is most obvious to be like that.</p>

<p>I think most of the time as a beginner we could get along with using the arrow keys and we should highly discourage it and use the emacs specific keybindings to move around within emacs. Apart from bringing the emacs on and starting it up, the very important thing we should remeber is how to close it. During my initial days as emacs user I was not aware of quitting emacs, and have of the time ended in killing emacs from the process tree, now I feel so stupid. C-g and C-x C-c are the commands, which can help you all the time, while we are learning. I have heard more advanced user of emacs seldom close their emacs sessions and I may try to forget using C-x C-C again. It may take some time till I get there and stop closing my emacs and I am sure it would be more than 30 days.</p>
