    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Good old saturday.</h3>

<p>Well it is the good old saturday, when I planned to blog about something after around 2 weeks.</p>

<h4>2 Weeks earlier</h4>

<p>Two weeks earlier I sat up, migrated my blog from pelican to octopress keeping the unerlying githubpages intact, hardly did I know after two week, I will again face the same problem what I did with pelican, anycase this time I was determined not to rework again on mihration to a nw platform, instead I will fix what was missing and will try to resolve the issue with octopress only.</p>

<h4>Today</h4>

<p>My octopress did worked fine without any error, I made some cosmetic changes to the blog and published some post. The problem is the blog and the changes are not being published, while I am making changes, the <code>rake deploy</code> did worked but I was not able to see anychanges happening to my blog page. But yes, the <code>rake preview</code> did worked fine and I was able to see my changes to localhost. Tried fixing it hard for sometimes but I didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>To make it work, I deleted my github.io repository from github, ran the command <code>rake github_setup_pages</code> pushed the content from my local repository back to github again, and well, after this I was able to see the changes on the web. That&rsquo;s a releif.</p>

<p>Finally, I made some cosmetic changes, write this as my notes on to what happened and how I fixed it. I also need to find out why it failed in the first place, I am assuming I changed my Laptop, that could be a reason, but this I am not convinced by this.</p>
